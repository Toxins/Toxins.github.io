* An evolving note [Morse](https://Toxins.github.io/pdfs/NotesforYangmills.pdf) [Topology of Gauge groups](https://Toxins.github.io/pdfs/Section2.pdf)for Atiyah & Bott "The Yang-Mills equation over riemann surfaces" The aim of this paper is to study the moduli space of stable holomorphic vector bundles over Riemann surfaces. I am reading section 6 now.

* Report of my HUA Seminar [note](https://Toxins.github.io/pdfs/huaseminar.pdf). In this note the representation of the fundamental groups is computed with methods in complex analysis. I think there is a Hodge-Theoritic perspective to this problem. 

* Final project for Complex Geometry [note](https://Toxins.github.io/pdfs/Notes on Calabi Yau Theorem.pdf) This note mainly refer to S.T.Yau "On the Ricci Curvature on the Compact Kähler Manifold and the Complex Monge-Ampére Equations" and H.D.Cao "Deformation of Kähler Metrics to Kähler-Einstein Metrics on Compact Kähler Manifolds". If time permits I would like to learn some modern approaches to the Monge-Ampére Equations.
